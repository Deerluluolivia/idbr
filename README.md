# idbr
An R interface to the US Census Bureau International Data Base API

This R package enables users to fetch international demographic indicators from the US Census Bureau's International Data Base API and return R data frames.  

I'm still working out a few things with the package before sending to CRAN; however if you'd like to try it out install with: 

```r
library(devtools)
install_github('walkerke/idbr')`
```

For some examples of how to use the package, I encourage you to check out a couple blog posts:
