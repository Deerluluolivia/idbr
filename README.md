# IDBr
An R interface to the US Census Bureau International Data Base API

This R package enables users to fetch international demographic indicators from the US Census Bureau's International Data Base API and return R data frames.  

The API is not stable yet.  However if you'd like to try it out install with: 

```r
library(devtools)
install_github('walkerke/IDBr')`
```
